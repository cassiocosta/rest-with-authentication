# REST API with Authentication

This project is a boilerplate for building a RESTful API using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and RSA key-based authentication.

## Features

- **DDD Architecture**: Layered organization into Domain, Business, Data, and API.
- **Authentication**: RSA-based security for reliable API authentication.
- **Tech Stack**: Developed with C# and .NET, suitable for scalable API applications.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cassiocosta/rest-with-authentication.git
   cd rest-with-authentication
   
2. Add RSA keys (rsa.private and rsa.public) in the appropriate folder.
3. Build and run the project:
  ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
  ```

## Usage
- **API Endpoints: Access various authenticated endpoints once the project is running.
